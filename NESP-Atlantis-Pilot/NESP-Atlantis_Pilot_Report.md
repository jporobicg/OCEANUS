## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful pilot test of the OCEANUS package for transforming hydrodynamic model outputs from structured grid format to unstructured polygon-based ecological model structure. The pilot test utilized BASS-2 hydrodynamic model data and demonstrated the complete workflow from data ingestion through mass balance correction to final Atlantis-compatible output.

### Key Results
- **Successfully processed** 147 Atlantis model boxes across 6 depth layers
- **Applied 1,440 mass balance corrections** across 30 time steps
- **Achieved 95.2% domain coverage** with proper handling of boundary conditions
- **Generated comprehensive visualizations** showing temperature and salinity distributions

## 1. Introduction

The OCEANUS package was developed to bridge the gap between hydrodynamic models using structured grids and ecological models requiring unstructured polygon-based spatial discretization. This pilot test validates the package's capability to process BASS-2 model outputs and transform them into a format compatible with the Atlantis ecosystem model framework.

### 1.1 Objectives
- Validate the complete data transformation workflow
- Test mass balance correction algorithms
- Assess spatial coverage and boundary handling
- Generate diagnostic visualizations

### 1.2 Test Domain
The pilot test focused on the Bass Strait region (140.4°E - 151.9°E, -41.4°N - -36.8°N) using:
- **BASS-2 hydrodynamic model output:** `bass2_simple_2017-11.nc`
- **Atlantis model geometry:** `SEAP_NESP_final_ll_fixed.bgm`
- **Processing period:** 30 time steps across 6 depth layers

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Transformation Workflow

The OCEANUS package implements a systematic approach to transform structured grid data into unstructured polygon-based output:

**Figure 1:** Complete data transformation workflow from BASS-2 hydrodynamic model to Atlantis model structure.

#### 2.1.1 Data Ingestion
- NetCDF file parsing and coordinate extraction
- Variable loading (u, v velocity components, temperature, salinity)
- Missing data handling and quality control

#### 2.1.2 Spatial Processing
- Face integration along polygon boundaries
- Layer-wise averaging across depth intervals
- Linear interpolation to face integration points

#### 2.1.3 Mass Balance Correction
- Net flux calculation for each box-layer combination
- Identification of empty faces (NaN or zero values)
- Application of corrections to maintain mass conservation

#### 2.1.4 Output Generation
- Polygon overlay on hydrodynamic fields
- Box connectivity mapping
- Final Atlantis-compatible NetCDF output

### 2.2 Technical Implementation

The transformation process follows the fundamental conservation equation:

$$\sum_{j \in \text{faces of box } i} T_{j,k} = 0$$

where $T_{j,k}$ represents the transport through face $j$ in layer $k$. When this constraint is violated, the algorithm applies corrections to empty faces connected to imbalanced boxes.

## 5. Diagnostic Analysis

### 5.1 Domain Coverage Issues

The diagnostic analysis identified several boxes outside the hydrodynamic domain:
- **7 boxes (4.8%)** completely outside domain
- **8 faces (1.2%)** outside domain
- **10 faces (1.5%)** partially inside domain

These boundary issues were handled appropriately by the correction algorithm.
